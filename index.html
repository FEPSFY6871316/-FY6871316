Since the invention of the internet, there has been an exponential growth in the communication of data across the globe. To protect this
data, cyber security is the topic for providing secure channels on the internet by using modern cryptography to encrypt and decrypt data
between two parties. But the future of quantum algorithms will render these useless once reliable quantum computers are made. IBM
are at the head of this, recently introducing their 'Quantum System Two' already far surpassing classical brute-force methods of
classical supercomputers using over 100 qubits to do this ([IBM Quantum System Two]), this article will go over the impact of
quantum cryptography in todays cybersecurity and what can be done to prevent cyber attacks with quantum-resistant encryption
techniques to mitigate this.

To begin with the fundamentals of cryptography, it is the process of manipulating the raw message (plaintext) into ciphertext (encryption)
from the sender with the goal of making it unrecognisable to an unwanted party that may intercept this (eavesdropper), ensuring the security
of the hidden message is kept between the two communicating parties for accessing this information ([Tech Target]). The receiver will use a
code(key) to decrypt the ciphertext to unlock the original message. From then up to modern cryptography we use this everyday in our lives whether
it may be authenticating your identity with a password or downloading something of the internet, to put simply, it is "the study of mathematical
techniques for securing digital information, systems, and distributed computations against adversarial attacks ."
([_Introduction to Modern Cryptography_, CRC Press LLC, 2014]). In the hyper-information age, we secure this digital information electronically
using i.e. algorithms that process by either manipulating the binary or hex in an irreversible way like a hash or generating large prime numbers
that modern computers find hard factoring and more that will be covered in the next section. Soon this will change, quantum physics is
not a new field in science but has been progressing with small breakthroughs over the years.
